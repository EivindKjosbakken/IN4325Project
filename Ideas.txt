Ideas:

-neural ranker (take inspiration from the second topic)
-different pre-processing techniques on the abstract texts
-basic tf-idf
-BM25
-filtration (on research group, faculty etc) when searching
-remove html tags in preprocessing
-tf idf should also check title and the other things (but don't implement yet because we are not sure if we are using tf idf)
-ways to speed up backend (takes 1 second now)
-should use the query log files to improve algorithm!
